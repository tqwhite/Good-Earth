What do you need?
==================

You can download the library with the download button.

Dependencies:

* jQuery

Why jQuery?
-----------
Slider.js uses jQuery because it provides a cross-browser and simple DOM API.
Anyway, it could be adapted to other libraries in the future.

Note for Slider.js developers
===================

The project is build with a Makefile and via the `make` command.
The command takes care to compile LESS and CoffeeScript code when files change.

There are some dependencies to make it work.

Required commands:

* `coffee`, to compile the CoffeeScript.
* `lessc`, to compile the LESS.
* `yuicompressor`, to minimize the Javascript.
* `docco`, to build the documentation. It is (currently) an NodeJS package

You are not required to use the Makefile if you simply want to adapt Slider.js to your website (you can just edit the compiled CSS and Javascript which are still readable) 
but if you want to contribute to Slider.js by pull request please use it to keep all compiled files "synchronized" in a coherent state.

TIPS
----
These are both command I use to run to focus on the development:

    while((1)); do make; sleep 1; done   # that's a little hacky but make does nothing if no file has changed

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001      # or equivalent to run a http server
